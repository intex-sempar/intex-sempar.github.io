## Overview

Executable semantic parsers map natural language utterances to meaning representations that can be executed in a particular context such as databases, knowledge graphs, robotic environment, and software applications. The field has become increasingly important as it allows users to seek information and control computer systems naturally and flexibly via interactive exchanges in natural language. We envision that practical semantic parsing systems need to be equipped with three core capabilities: 

    - Understanding user utterances in context and mapping them to executable forms.
    - Clarifying ambiguous utterances and providing guidance for user to form valid input.
    - Providing a faithful explanation of its interpreted actions for user verification and feedback.

To this end, the problem of mapping well-formed, individual natural language utterances to formal representations has been studied extensively.

In comparison, semantic parsing in an interactive setup has received less attention until very recently. Furthermore, most of existing semantic parsers assume valid input only hence cannot detect ambiguous/invalid utterances and clarify them effectively.
There is also less focus on explainablility and trustworthiness, where the system can explain its interpreted actions to the user for verification and feedback.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers and promote exciting work towards powerful, robust and reliable interactive executable semantic parsing systems. We seek submissions in two tracks:

    - A research track for presenting novel contributions relevant but not limited to the directions mentioned above.
    - A shared task track on the newly introduced conversational text-to-SQL challenge ([CoSQL](https://yale-lily.github.io/cosql)).
