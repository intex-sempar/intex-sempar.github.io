# NEW: Present your "Findings of EMNLP" papers at our workshop

We invited the authors of the accepted "Findings of EMNLP" papers to present at our workshop!
We welcome any papers fitted in our workshop CFP topics.
You can submit your papers to our submission system (https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2020/intex-sempar2020/), or directly email us at intex-sempar@googlegroups.com with your paper information.

# Call for Papers
Executable semantic parsers map natural language utterances to meaning representations that can be executed in a particular context such as databases, knowledge graphs, robotic environment, and software applications. The field has become increasingly important as it allows users to seek information and control computer systems naturally and flexibly via interactive exchanges in natural language. We envision that practical semantic parsing systems need to be equipped with three core capabilities: 

- Understanding user utterances in context and mapping them to executable forms.
- Clarifying ambiguous utterances and providing guidance for user to form valid input.
- Providing a faithful explanation of its interpreted actions for user verification and feedback.

To this end, the problem of mapping well-formed, individual natural language utterances to formal representations has been studied extensively.

In comparison, semantic parsing in an interactive setup has received less attention until very recently. Furthermore, most of existing semantic parsers assume valid input only hence cannot detect ambiguous/invalid utterances and clarify them effectively.
There is also less focus on explainability and trustworthiness, where the system can explain its interpreted actions to the user for verification and feedback.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers and promote exciting work towards powerful, robust, and reliable interactive executable semantic parsing systems. We seek submissions in two tracks:

- A research track for presenting novel contributions relevant but not limited to the directions mentioned above.
- A shared task track on the newly introduced conversational text-to-SQL challenge ([CoSQL](https://yale-lily.github.io/cosql))

We welcome submissions on research that broadly relates to interactive executable semantic parsing on topics including but not limited to:

- New Semantic Parsing Paradigms, Tasks, and Datasets
- New Methods for Semantic Parsing
- Evaluation Metrics for Semantic Parsing Systems
- Interactive Semantic Parsing
- Conversational Semantic Parsing
- Interpretability and Trustworthiness of Semantic Parsing Systems
- Data Visualization in Semantic Parsing Systems
- Language Explanation of Semantic Parsing Systems
- Semantic Parsing in Databases
- Semantic Parsing in Knowledge Graphs
- Semantic Parsing in Robotics and Navigation
- Semantic Parsing in Game Environments
- Semantic Parsing in Software Applications
- Visually Grounded Semantic Parsing
- Multilingual Semantic Parsing
- Weakly Supervised Semantic Parsing

## Submission Guidelines
Submissions should be at most 8 pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references.
Accepted papers will be given 1 additional content page, so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account. 
Please use the [standard ACL style files](https://2020.emnlp.org/call-for-papers) to format your papers and submit them electronically via our [submission site](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2020/intex-sempar2020/).
Our reviewing policy is double-blind, and the submissions should be fully anonymized.
We also allow submissions that are under review in other venues or have preprint versions.
Especially, you can submit your EMNLP 2020 submissions to this workshop as well.
